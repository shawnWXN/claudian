# Claudian

An Obsidian plugin that embeds Claude Agent (using Claude Agent SDK) as a sidebar chat interface. Your vault becomes Claude's working directory, giving it full agentic capabilities: file read/write, bash commands, and multi-step workflows.

## Features

- **Full Agentic Capabilities**: Leverage Claude Code's power to read, write, and edit files, and execute bash commands, all within your Obsidian vault.
- **Context-Aware**: Automatically attach the focused note, mention files with `@`, and exclude notes by tag for precise context management.
- **Vision Support**: Analyze images by sending them via drag-and-drop, paste, or file path.
- **Inline Edit**: Edit selected text directly in notes with word-level diff preview and read-only tool access for context.
- **Dynamic Responses**: Experience real-time streaming, observe Claude's extended reasoning process, and cancel responses mid-stream.
- **Advanced Model Control**: Select between Haiku, Sonnet, and Opus, configure custom models via environment variables, and fine-tune thinking budget.
- **Transparent Tooling**: Visualize tool calls, subagent activity, and track asynchronous subagent operations with detailed UI feedback.
- **Persistent Sessions**: Save and resume conversations with full context across sessions.
- **Robust Security**: Implement permission modes (Yolo/Safe), a safety blocklist, and vault confinement with symlink-safe checks.
- **Intuitive File Management**: See indicators for edited files, with smart detection, auto-dismissal, and quick access.

## Requirements

- [Claude Code CLI](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) installed (the SDK uses it internally)
- Obsidian v1.8.9+
- Claude subscription/API or Custom model provider that supports anthropic API format (Kimi, GLM, DeepSeek, etc.)
- Desktop only (support macOS, not tested on Linux or Windows)

## Installation

### From source (development)

1. Clone this repository into your vault's plugins folder:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/vault/.obsidian/plugins
   git clone https://github.com/YishenTu/claudian.git
   cd claudian
   ```

2. Install dependencies and build:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

3. Enable the plugin in Obsidian:
   - Settings → Community plugins → Enable "Claudian"

### Development

```bash
# Watch mode (auto-rebuild on changes)
npm run dev

# Production build
npm run build
```

## Usage

**Two modes:**
1. Click the bot icon in the ribbon or CMD+P to open Claudian on sidebar
2. Select text in any note and press hotkey to open inline edit

Use it like Claude Code, ask it to read, write, edit, search, etc. to help you with your notes.

### File Context

- **Auto-attach**: New conversations auto-attach the currently focused note
- **@ mention**: Type `@` anywhere to search and attach files from your vault
- **Remove**: Click `×` on a file chip to remove it
- **Excluded tags**: Notes with tags listed in Settings → Excluded tags won't auto-attach (but can still be manually attached via `@`)
- Files are sent as context with your message; Claude will read them to understand your question

### Image Context

Send images to Claude via drag-and-drop, paste (Cmd/Ctrl+V), or file path in your message.

**Supported:** JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP (max 5MB)

**Embedded images:** Configure media folder in settings, then Claude can read `![[image.png]]` references.

### Inline Edit

Interact with selected text directly in your notes - ask questions or request edits - without opening the sidebar chat.

1. **Select text** in any note
2. **Press hotkey** (configure via Settings → Hotkeys → "Claudian: Inline edit")
3. **Enter request** - either a question ("what does this do?") or edit instruction ("fix grammar")
4. **View response** - questions get conversational answers, edits show inline diff
5. **For edits**: Accept (Enter) or Reject (Esc)

**Features:**
- **Questions & edits**: Ask about selected text or request modifications
- **Multi-turn conversation**: Agent can ask clarifying questions
- **Read-only tools**: Agent can read files and search the web for context
- **Inline diff**: Precise word-level diff with red strikethrough (deletions) and green highlight (insertions)

The inline edit agent has access to `Read`, `Grep`, `Glob`, `LS`, `WebSearch`, and `WebFetch` tools for gathering context, but write tools are blocked.

### Example prompts

- "List all notes in this vault"
- "Create a new note called 'Ideas' with a template for brainstorming"
- "Find all notes tagged #project and summarize them"
- "Organize my daily notes into monthly folders"
- "Summarize this note" (with a note attached via @ or auto-attach)

## Configuration

### Settings

- **Enable command blocklist**: Block dangerous bash commands (default: on)
- **Blocked commands**: Patterns to block (supports regex)
- **Show tool usage**: Display file operations in chat
- **Excluded tags**: Tags that prevent notes from auto-loading (e.g., `sensitive`, `private`)
- **Media folder**: Configure where vault stores attachments for embedded image support (e.g., `attachments`)
- **Environment variables**: Custom environment variables for Claude SDK (KEY=VALUE format)
- **Environment snippets**: Save and restore environment variable configurations
- **Permission mode**: Toggle Yolo (bypass prompts) or Safe (require approval)
- **Approved actions**: In Safe mode, manage permanently approved actions (Allow Once vs. Always Allow)

### Safety and permissions

- **Vault restriction**: File tools and Bash commands are limited to the Obsidian vault. Paths are resolved with `realpath` to prevent symlink escapes; attempts outside the vault are blocked.
- **Approvals**:
  - Safe mode shows an approval modal per tool call.
  - Bash approvals require an exact command match.
  - File tools allow exact or prefix path matches.
- **Command blocklist**:
  - `rm -rf`
  - `chmod 777`
  - `chmod -R 777`
  - etc. 

## Privacy & Data Use

- **Outbound scope**: Content sent to Claude/custom APIs includes your input, attached files/snippets, images (base64), and model-issued tool calls plus summarized outputs. Default provider is Anthropic; if `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` is set, traffic goes to that endpoint.
- **Local storage**: Settings, chat history, approved actions, and environment variable snippets are stored in `.obsidian/plugins/claudian`. Image cache is written to `.claudian-cache/images`; you can clear it when deleting conversations or uninstalling the plugin.
- **Commands & file access**: The plugin can read/write files and execute Bash commands within the vault directory; Safe mode approvals and the blocklist apply, and paths are constrained to the vault via `realpath`.
- **User controls**: You can edit the blocked-command list, switch Safe/Yolo modes, clear history, delete caches, and remove API keys; disabling the plugin stops all remote calls.
- **Telemetry**: No additional telemetry or third-party tracking. Data retention/compliance follows the terms of your configured API provider.
